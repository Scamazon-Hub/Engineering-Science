            <h2 id="introduction">Course Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Higher National Certificate (HNC) in Mechanical Engineering provides a specialist vocational programme, linked to professional body requirements and with a strong work-related emphasis. This guide covers the fundamental principles and applications that form the backbone of this qualification.
            </p>

            <h2 id="core-subjects">Core Subject Areas</h2>
            <p>
                Below is an outline of the primary subject areas typically covered in the HNC programme. Each section of this guide will delve into these topics in detail.
            </p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Key Topics Include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Engineering Mathematics:</strong> The essential mathematical tools and techniques required to solve engineering problems, from algebra and trigonometry to calculus and differential equations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statics & Dynamics:</strong> Understanding forces, moments, and their effects on stationary and moving bodies. This forms the basis of structural design and mechanical analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Materials Science:</strong> Exploring the properties of engineering materials (metals, polymers, composites) and how they behave under different loads and environmental conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics:</strong> The study of energy, heat transfer, and the behaviour of fluids, which is critical for designing engines, power systems, and hydraulic/pneumatic circuits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid Mechanics & Machine Design:</strong> Applying principles of stress, strain, and failure to design and analyse mechanical components and systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical Principles:</strong> A foundational understanding of electrical and electronic circuits, essential for modern mechatronic systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <p><strong>How to Use This Guide:</strong> Start with the foundational concepts in the 'Core Principles' section before moving to more specialised 'Applied Engineering' topics. Use the search function to quickly find specific subjects.</p>
